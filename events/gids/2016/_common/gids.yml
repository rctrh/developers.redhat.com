    title: 'Introduction to OpenShift 3'
    url: http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/session.html?insert=GrahamDumpleton1
    date: 'Tuesday, April 26, 2016'
    abstract: "OpenShift 3 reinvents what it means to be a Platform as a Service. Using Docker for containerisation and Kubernetes for container orchestration and management, combined with a self-service model for provisioning your projects and applications using predefined workflows, OpenShift offers a best in class solution for hosting your applications in the cloud. The flexibility, yet ease of use of OpenShift enables your organisation to better face the challenge of automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes, as well as catering for the new DevOps culture. In this session you will be provided with a deep dive overview of OpenShift 3, illustrating how it is more than just a PaaS, but a comprehensive Container Application Platform."

    date: 'Tuesday, April 26'
    abstract: "Yes, Docker is great! We are all very aware of that but now it's time to take the next step: wrapping it all and deploying to a production environment. For this scenario we need something more. For that \"more\" we have Kubernetes by Google - a container platform based on the same technology used to deploy billions of containers per month on Google's infrastructure.<br><br>Ready to leverage your Docker skills? Come to this session to see how your current Docker skillset can be easily mapped to Kubernetes concepts and commands. And get ready to deploy your containers in production!"

    url: http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/session.html?insert=SebastienBlanc1
    date: 'Wednesday, April 27, 2016'
    abstract: "In the 1990s, the World Wide Web was just a collection of static pages with zero interactivity. Today the \"new\" web has a plethora of emerging frameworks and tools, simply increasing the number of threats. The complexity of software development has also grown with the need for things like single-sign-on support, social identity providers, securing REST services. Delegating the security logic to an external framework is the way to ensure some best practices. This 0 slide / 100% live coding session will demonstrate how to secure your applications with Keycloak."

    title: 'Connecting AngularJS to Agnostic Microservices Endpoints'
    url: http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/session.html?insert=EdsonYanaga1
    date: 'Wednesday, April 27, 2016'
    abstract: "AngularJS is your choice of client-side technology for webapps, but you're not that sure yet for the server-side technology. We have an ever growing number of different frameworks and tools that are supposed to support client-side technologies in a Microservices architecture. And you want all of that to run on containers, with fault-tolerance and high availability, in a non-complicated way. Come to this session to see how popular frameworks and tools can rescue you in this uncharted path through the Microservices jungle. We'll cover all the cool stuff like Wildfly Swarm, Spring Boot, DropWizard, NodeJS, Docker, OpenShift, Jenkins, Kubernetes and maybe much more!"

    date: 'Thursday, April 28, 2016'
    abstract: "As Mark Twain once said \"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated\". This statement may now easily be applied to Java. Even if the official stewards of Java seemed to have lost their enthusiasm, there are many groups and companies supporting and thriving with Java. Innovation is occurring within the enterprise Java space at a constant rate, more organizations are solving new and exciting problems with advanced Java technologies and project. Java is not dead."

    title: 'Getting More Done With JBoss Forge: A Gentle Path into Java EE 7 Applications'
    url: http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/session.html?insert=SebastienBlanc2
    date: 'Thursday, April 28, 2016'
    abstract: "Creating a new Java EE Application is a daunting task. Choosing the specifications you need for your application and mixing and matching them is difficult, especially for newbies. In this presentation we will show how JBoss Forge can help overcome these difficulties. We will use it to first create a Java EE application that uses most of the Java EE specifications (JPA, Bean Validation, CDI, JSF, JAX-RS...) and afterwards test it (JUnit and Arquillian). From a white sheet, JBoss Forge will help us to quick start the application and gradually add extra features to it. Finally we will end up with a fully functional and testable application.<br><br>If you attend this session, you will know how JBoss Forge guides you gently up the hill of Java EE application development."

    title: 'A Developer&apos;s Journey From Monoliths to Microservices'
    url: http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/session.html?insert=EdsonYanaga2
    date: 'Thursday, April 28, 2016'
    abstract: "Microservices are the current \"big thing\" and most of the current technologies seems to be a fit for greenfield projects. Unfortunately the great majority of the developers can't build something from scratch - but that shouldn't prevent them to touch the world of microservices while dealing with their legacy monolith.<br><br>Come to this session to check how we are refactoring a Java EE monolith to a Microservices Architecture: our work done and the planned steps. Because enterprise development is not just a \"hello world\" application: it's a journey. We'll discuss the architectural decisions, requirements and implications. And of course we've plenty of code and deployments in a DevOps-enabled platform!"

    title: 'Develop & Deploy Cloud-native Apps as Resilient Microservices Architectures'
    url: http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/session.html?insert=BurrSutter2
    date: 'Thursday, April 28, 2016'
    abstract: "You've been hearing about Microservices for months, and probably have taken a look about 12-factor and cloud-native apps too. But there's a myriad of different frameworks and tools that you can use to craft your software and join the pieces together into a Microservices Architecture. You want to use the best tool for the job, and you need a hassle-free DevOps pipeline to orchestrate and deploy all of them. Join this session to see how you can combine a lot of different technologies and tools in a live demo that will open your eyes for the huge possibilities that Microservices can enable you to achieve. We'll have it all: containers, Docker, Wildfly Swarm, Spring Boot, NodeJS, .NET, OpenShift, Jenkins, Kubernetes and perhaps much more."

    date: 'Friday, April 29, 2016'
    abstract: "In this session, we will describe, discuss and demonstrate an industrial/enterprise-oriented architecture associated with large scale sensor rollout, covering critical areas such as ingestion, integration and analytics. You will learn how to connect the physical world to your traditional enterprise IT infrastructure (Apache Camel), supporting high-speed sensor data acquisition (Apache ActiveMQ) with real-time (Apache SparkStreaming) analytics. In addition, we will show-off various IoT developer prototyping platforms like Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, Arduino, NXP 1768 with mbed, Particle.io Photon and more."
